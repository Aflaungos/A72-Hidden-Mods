# A72-Hidden-Mods
A magisk module adding the mods from ShaDisNX255's [XDA-Thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/samsung-galaxy-a71-working-mods.4173295/) and his [NcX Rom](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/rom-oneui-2-5-twrp-ncx-2-5-for-a71-sm-a715f.4174135/) plus some extra mods systemlessly, now ported to the Galaxy A72!<br/>
Thanks ShaDisNX255 for contributing so much! Many features came from him.

### For native Call Recording and AppLock also get: https://github.com/UltraHQ/A72-CSC-Mods

Installation:
1. Download the module from the releases
2. Open the magisk app and go to modules
3. Click the "Install from storage" button and select the .zip you just downloaded 

In case the camera app is crashing, when for example selecting pro video mode, delete the camera app data and the issue should be gone.

> Note: It should only be used on the Galaxy A72 (SM-A725F) running Android 11 with the corresponding android security patch version as written in the releases. Trying on other devices is at your own risk.<br/>The changes are always reversable, by simply removing the module in magisk.
