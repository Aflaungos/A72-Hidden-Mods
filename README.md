# A72-Hidden-Mods
A magisk module adding the mods from ShaDisNX255's [XDA-Thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/samsung-galaxy-a71-working-mods.4173295/) plus many extra mods systemlessly!<br/>
Thanks ShaDisNX255 for allowing me to use your features! Without you, this project would've never started.

### For more mods on CSC-Level also get: [A72-CSC-Mods](https://github.com/UltraHQ/A72-CSC-Mods)

Installation:
1. Download the module from the releases
2. Open the magisk app and go to modules
3. Click the "Install from storage" button and select the .zip you just downloaded 

In case the camera app is crashing, when for example selecting pro video mode, delete the camera app data and the issue should be gone.

> Note: It should only be used on the Galaxy A72 (SM-A725F) running the corresponding android security patch version as written in the releases. Trying on other devices is at your own risk.<br/>The changes are always reversable, by simply removing the module in magisk.
