A magisk module adding the mods from ShaDisNX255's [XDA-Thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/samsung-galaxy-a71-working-mods.4173295/) and his [NcX Rom](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/rom-oneui-2-5-twrp-ncx-2-5-for-a71-sm-a715f.4174135/) plus some extra mods systemlessly, now ported to the Galaxy A72!<br/>
