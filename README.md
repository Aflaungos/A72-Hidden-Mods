### ⚙️ Installation:
1. Download the module from the releases
2. Open the magisk app and go to modules
3. Click the "Install from storage" button and select the .zip you just downloaded 

> ⚠️ Note: It should only be used on the Galaxy M23/F23 (SM-M236B/SM-E236B) running the corresponding android security patch version as written in the releases. <br/>The changes are always reversile, by simply removing the module in magisk.

### ❔ Troubleshooting:
- Back Camera 1080p 60FPS: Video stutters, disable auto fps and stabilization
- If camera app crashes (or other issues like error on 50MP mode) please clear camera app data.
- If system apps start crashing, boot into your Recovery and on
