[XDA Thread of M23 Hidden Mods](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/mod-oneui-m23-hidden-mods.4626443)

### Installation:
1. Download the module from the releases
2. Open the magisk app and go to modules
3. Click the "Install from storage" button and select the .zip you just downloaded 

> Note: It should only be used on the Galaxy M23/F23 (SM-M236B/SM-E236B) running the corresponding android security patch version as written in the releases. <br/>The changes are always reversile, by simply removing the module in magisk.
